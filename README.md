####For the code folder please goto master branch ####
Problem Statement:
In todays World Many people are suffering from Diabetes in order to know their status of the Diabetes in future .This  Application will helps to  those people. 

soluation :
In this project going to use Machine learning Algorithms to predict whether a person has Diabetes or not based on their different parameters like Blood Pressure ,Glucose, Insulin ,BMI .by inputting these values in our app  and also app shows the suggestable methods to control their Diabetes of  In project going to use an framework from Python flask is used as backend and Html and CSS  will going  use to design User Interface. 

In this project i used two or more services from the azure i.e 
1. Azure Machine Learning Model 
2.Azure App Service
3. Azure Open datasets 
4.Visual Studio code .

1. Azure Machine Learning Studio :
In this project i used the Azure Machine Learning Service. Using the service i trained the machine learning model and push into the github -master branch FRT-Internship-Project Repo 
i am attaching screen shot in the github repo 

2. Using the app service i depolyed the webapp in HTTPS .

3. Using Open Datasets i taken the dataset 

4. Using Visual Code i coded for the flask depolyement .

Here i am attaching all the screenshots in my github repo please take reference from that .
